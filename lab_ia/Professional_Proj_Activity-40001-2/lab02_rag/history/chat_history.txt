User: Which are the last 4 news?
Bot: <think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which are the last four news from the provided context. Let me go through each entry step by step.

First, looking at the list of events:

1. "Читайте также Как электронные сигареты влияют на органы дыхания 11:31" — This is a news item about electronic sigarets affecting respiratory organs.
2. "Биокад" судится с "АстраЗенекой" из-за нового онкопрепарата 09.06.2025, 09:57 — This seems like a news about a new hypopercarpate operation in the Russian Federation.
3. "Как готовят спортсменов в футбольной академии 05.06.2025, 11:50" — This is about preparing athletes for football academia.
4. "Назван новый способ пополнения карты «Тройка» 04.06.2025, 14:22" — This mentions a new method to fill the "Triplets" card.
5. "В такси выросло число поездок с детьми 30.05.2025, 19:47" — This is about increased taxi rides with children.

Now, I need to determine which of these are recent news. Let's check the dates:

- The last event mentioned is "В такси выросло число поездок с детьми 30.05.2025, 19:47" from May 30, 2025.
- The previous events are all in June and July of 2025.

So the last four news would be the most recent ones. But looking at the list, there are only five entries. If we consider "в такси" as the fifth, then maybe the last four include this one along with others from earlier dates. Wait, but the user is asking for the last four in general.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The context lists events up to May 30, 2025, and the next event would be June 5th. But since there are only five entries, maybe the last four include all except the first one. However, without more context on what's considered recent, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps "в такси" is the fifth news item, so if we're looking for the last four in a list that includes these, but since there are only five, maybe the last four would be from May 30 and earlier. But I'm not sure about the exact order.

Wait, let me recount:

1. 11:31
2. 09:57
3. 05:06
4. 14:22
5. 19:47

So if we're listing all news in chronological order, the last four would be from May 30, 2025, and earlier dates until June 5, 2025.

But without knowing what's considered recent, it's tricky. Maybe the user is referring to the most recent ones after a certain point. Alternatively, perhaps "в такси" is the last one, so if we're considering the last four in order, it would be from May 30 onwards and before June 5.

But I think the best approach is to list all five entries as news items and pick the last four based on their occurrence. So the last four would include "в такси", then the next ones until perhaps another event after that date.

Wait, but without more context, it's hard to determine exactly which are the last four. However, since there are only five events, I think the user is asking for all of them as news items, so maybe they just want a list of these five.
